# Advent of Code 2022 solutions

My take on solving the advent of code 2022. A little late, but I wanted to
refresh and try various programming languages which I hadn't used in a while.

I try to use different programming languages for each day. This means,
that probably these are not the most optimal solution in most cases, or
the most polished. It's just a pass time.
